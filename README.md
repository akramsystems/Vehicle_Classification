# Vehicle_Classification
Using a 5 layered Neural Net and the Softmax function Pytorch to predict the vehicle given a set of 18 features

Dataset from the UCI dataset library I've included it here for convenience so you can test it out.

I didnt include all the data only used a small subset of the actual data.

This algorithm can be used anywhere you need to do classification between different categories or classes
something might belong to given a set of training data, if you are going to be changing the dimensions of the data or anything 
just make sure to update the Net() funciton to match the number of inputs and outputs you want
